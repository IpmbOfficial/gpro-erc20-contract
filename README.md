# GoldPro ERC20 Token (GPRO)

**GPRO** is an ERC20 token deployed on the Polygon (PoS) blockchain, following OpenZeppelin's guidelines. The GPRO token supports minting, burning, and batch transfers. This repository contains the Solidity smart contract code for the GPRO token.

## Features

-   **ERC20 Standard**: GPRO adheres to the ERC20 token standard, making it compatible with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications.
-   **Minting**: Upon deployment, the contract mints a fixed supply of tokens to the deployer's wallet.
-   **Burning**: Token holders can burn their tokens to reduce the total supply, providing deflationary mechanics.
-   **Batch Transfers**: A convenient batch transfer function enables the transfer of tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction.
